# Boniville Student Accommodation Website

I created this website for Boniville Student Accommodation, a housing facility serving students at the University of Mpumalanga. The goal was to provide an intuitive, modern platform for students to explore accommodation options, view amenities, and streamline the booking process. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website emphasizes usability, accessibility, and responsiveness across all devices.
